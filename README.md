# Employee Tracker - Challenge 12

## Description:

* As a developer, I wanted to create a command-line-based application that will connect with the employee_db database to render information about employees, their roles and departments, and also be able to add new roles, departments and employees to the database.

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

WHEN I choose to view all departments
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids
WHEN I choose to view all roles
THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
WHEN I choose to view all employees
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
WHEN I choose to add a department
THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database
